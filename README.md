Holy Speech
==================

This web app helps you memorize speeches. First, it prompts you to enter your speech in a specific format: phrase-paragraph pairs. For each paragraph/section of your speech, you need to provide a brief description. Then, it displays your unmodified speech to you and tells you to read it out loud all the way through. Easy Peasy.

Here's where the web app comes in: once you've finished reading your speech (each read-through is a "round"), the web app goes through and replaces some of the words with blanks. Now, when you read through it, you'll need to fill in a small number of gaps. It removes more and more words each round. Eventually, only the phrases that describe each paragraph will remain, and you will have succeeded in memorizing your speech.

Note: I've yet to test how useful this method of speech memorization really is. I'll update this readme when I do.
